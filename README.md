**Situations Solved**

With this point Panduza provides a solution to

- embedded engineers too often forced to work constantly in their lab (close to the physical boards)
- managers that need to share hardware between embedded engineers in different location
- engineers that need to collaborate with other engineers
- engineers that want to work on their project from anywhere in the world


### Standardize device interfaces

Panduza provides a abstraction layer to standardize access to devices

**Situations Solved**

With this point Panduza provides a solution to

- engineers that want to improve their test bench
- enginneers that are tired of all those imcompatible devices


### Improve Cyber Security

Panduza provides tools to
