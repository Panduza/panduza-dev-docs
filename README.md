## They talk about us !

- [ADVANS LAB](https://www.elsys-design.com/fr/panduza-pour-un-labo-connecte-2-0/)


## Goals

Goals of Panduza are:

### Allow remote control of devices

Panduza provides a way to access the lab from the network.

**Situations Solved**

With this point Panduza provides a solution to

- embedded engineers too often forced to work constantly in their lab (close to the physical boards)
- managers that need to share hardware between embedded engineers in different location
- engineers that need to collaborate with other engineers
- engineers that want to work on their project from anywhere in the world


### Standardize device interfaces

Panduza provides a abstraction layer to standardize access to devices

**Situations Solved**

With this point Panduza provides a solution to

- engineers that want to improve their test bench
- enginneers that are tired of all those imcompatible devices

### Improve Test Bench Creation

Panduza provides support for Testers

With this point Panduza provides a solution to

- engineers that want to use lab devices with test framework
- engineers that want to see interfaces status on a graphic app an the same time

### Ensure cyber security

Panduza provides tools to ensure security
