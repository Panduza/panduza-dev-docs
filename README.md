# Panduza

Panduza is a software ecosystem for embedded engineers to remotely control their electronic laboratory.

It is an **open-source** and **collaborative** project.

## Goals

Panduza aims to :

### Allow remote control of any electronic equipment through a network.

**Problems solved**

- Embedded engineers are too often forced to work constantly in their lab (close to the physical boards)
- Managers need to share hardware between embedded engineers in different location
- Embedded engineers need to collaborate with other teams or coworkers
- Embedded engineers want to work on their project from anywhere in the world
- Monitoring made easy with video streaming and graphic representation of the equipment


### Standardize device interfaces

Panduza provides a universal API to standardize access to devices.

**Problems Solved**

- Two power supplies may have the same features but very different ways to be addressed. With Panduza, all the devices from a same family will be accessible via universal interfaces
- Engineers save time and avoid reinventing the wheel every time a new equipment must be used

### Improve Test Bench Creation

Panduza provides support for testers.

**Problems Solved**

- Engineers can benefit from a flexible system that interfaces with the most common test frameworks on the market
- Through very user-friendly Python and C++ APIs, test creation doesn't require highly skilled programmers and bulky code
- Test benches are easily reusable from one project to another
- Test creation and monitoring made possible with intuitive graphic applications where no coding is required

### Ensure cyber security

Panduza provides tools to ensure security
