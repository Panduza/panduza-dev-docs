Welcome to the Panduza project documentation.

## Quick ! Tell me what is Panduza !?

Panduza is the ultimate solution to modernize your test bench.

Panduza aims the "**T**est **B**ench **A**s **A** **S**ervice" concept.

You setup your test benches once in your lab then you access it in remote and share it with your colleague or CI/CD Tools or even IA tools...
