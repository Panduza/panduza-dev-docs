Interfaces are mainly composed of 

- Interface Data
- FSM (Finite State Machine): Manage internal workflow of the interface
- Listener: manage incoming message from the connection

FSM et Listener have their own task.

Other helper components:

- Logger: Helper to log information that come from this specific interface
