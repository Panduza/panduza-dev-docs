Interface declaration is very easy thanks to the usb serial id of the device.

Just provides the **serial_short** and panduza will fetch it for you.

```json
{
    "name": "my power supply",
    "driver": "py.psu.aimtty.ql355p",
    "settings": {
        "serial_short": "TTS1IJFH"
    }
}
```

**TODO**: extract usefull informations for remote control and remove the pdf
